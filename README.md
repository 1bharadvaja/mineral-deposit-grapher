Trained a vanilla MLP on 32k sample data points from the Macpass mining project in Canada (ideally i would have much more)
Took the model and now am running inference on server endpoint, which for now is just localhost, and then uploading inference results based on csv data that you can directly upload
Next steps:

1. add shapefile upload ability, extrapolate shapefile info geospatial data to be able to select inference area on a map
2. train better models (need more data for that!)
3. Make UI nicer
